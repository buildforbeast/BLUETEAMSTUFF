Yara is tool used for finding strings attach to program to find any malicious suspicious patterns.

	1. You can identify information based on both binary and textual patterns

For example 

Ransomware have string for bitcoin wallent payment : 12t9y5245aaapuf87
Botnet sets ip for command and control : 12.71.56.7

We can set rules to find specific ip's or strings like above

Base16 which is also called hex Yara can detect it

------------------------YARA------------------
Yara command requires only two arguments
The rule file you created
Name of file,process id to use rule for

For example 
 yara myrule.yar  file/pid 2202

Rule example:

 nano myfirstrule.yar   in it
Rule examplerule { condition :True}
 use extension .yar for yara
 in this file it setting a rule to check if file exist. 
If file exist it will gave output examplerule file
If not it throw error no file exist 

Yara have conditions to read like keywords,desc(description), meta,strings conditions,weight ,etc.

Meta is a section reserved for author of yara rule
Strings is search for specific text or hex
Conditions can be : >+, <= ,!=

For little string example 
If we want to find a string of hello world! ,Hello World!, HELLO WORLD!

We can make rule like
                rule helloworld_checker{
Strings:
               $hello_world= "Hello World!"
              $hello_world= "HELLO WORLD!"
              $hello_world= "hello world!"

 condition:
           any of them 
}

Some cheat sheet are

You don’t have to create yara rules from scratch there are already tools out there on github  for linux and windows
https://github.com/InQuest/awesome-yara
Loki 
Is free of opensource ioc scanner 
It detect on 4 methods
	• File name
	• Yara rule
	• Hash check 
	• C2 back connect check

Yargen is another tool for genrating yara rules for analysis of code which is long as hell will be difficult so we use yargen 

To generate rules for specific files(because some code contain prebuilt software strings which are no use for analysis )

Python3 yarGen.py  --update
Python3 yarGen.py -m <for file u want to generate rule> --excludegood -o < where to output files rules>
