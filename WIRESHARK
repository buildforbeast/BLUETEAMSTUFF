Wireshark is network traffic capturing tool it capture and analyis traffic what is going on in their . To capture data there are numerous method to capture data which is also called live packet capturing  it can be using taps ,port mirroring , MAC floods, ARP poisoning 

NETWORK TAP USED BY RED TEAM THREAT HUNTER TO SNIFF NETWORK

MAC FLOODS STRESS SWITCH TO FLOOD SHOULD BE USED WITH CAUTION BUT WE CAN ALSO USE ARP POISONING WHICH DONâ€™T STRESS SWITCH 


Wireshark filter syntax 

And : and / &&
Or  : or / ||
Equals: eq / ==
Not equal: ne /  !=
Greater than : gt / >
Less than : lt / <

Basic filtering syntax
Filtering by ip
  ip.addr == <ip address
Filtering by ports
  tcp.port eq <port> or <protocol name> same as for udp 

           ARP Packet Analysis

ARP analysis is simple the most important field of arp is opcode and mac address
Opcode can be request/response

           ICMP Traffic 

If it is request packet then type code will be 8
If it is reply packet then it will be 0
If they are alterred by suspicious activity then number can be different


           TCP Packet Analysis
Tcp packet is known as tcp handshake it includes series of syn,syn ack, ack.


           DNS Packet Analysis

Three things to lookup while analysing dns
Queries-response
UDP
DNS-Server only


If packet coming form udp its perfect but if packet coming from tcp than it will be suspicious 


            HTTP Packet Analysis

Http is straight forward 
On packet right click we can roam in h

To hunt or identify discrepancies in packet captures we have
Statistics bar > Protocol hierarchy
File bar > Export objects > HTTP

            HTTPS Packet Analysis

To analyis https traffic we must have the tls decryption key for that traffic than if you have that key you can go decrypt or downgrade https to http
Edit bar > Preferences > Protocols > TLS > edit


Then add ip address,port,protocol,keyfile the key for decryption
